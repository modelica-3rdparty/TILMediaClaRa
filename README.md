# TILMedia ClaRa

TILMedia ClaRa is a Modelica library implemented in C/C++.


## Description

The calculation of thermophysical properties with the TILMedia Modelica interface is divided in five groups:
<br>
</p><ul>
  <li> <b>Gas</b> - Ideal gases and mixtures with one component that can condense - gas vapor</li>
  <li> <b>Liquid</b> - Incompressible single phase fluids and mixtures</li>
  <li> <b>VLEFluid</b> - Real fluid or fluid mixture, which can be liquid, vaporous, super-critical or may have a vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE)</li>
  <li> <b>Solid</b> - Single phase solids</li>
  <li> <b>SLEMedium</b> - can be solid, liquid or may have a solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE)</li>
</ul>
